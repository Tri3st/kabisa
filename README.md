# Kabisa Assignment

## The assignment

The assignment was to create a web service. To generate random quotes from famouse people.

## Result

I was not able to get the whole thing running on a webserver. So I made a docker container for the database.
This holds user information and authentication.
Also it holds the quotes, authors and number of likes.

The frondend/backend is made with django/djangoRestFramework

I tried to let it look a bit nice. But my design-skills are not that fantastic.

## Conclusion

It was fun to do and try to see how far I can get with the assignment.
Looking forward to our talk.
